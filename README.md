## Molecular Dynamics Simulation

---

Project to simulate motion of atoms / molecules based off forces they exert on each other.

Start with simulating an Ar-Ar interaction, getting interatomic energies from Lennard-Jones potential.

Intention is to scale further to work with a useful number of molecules, and branch out
